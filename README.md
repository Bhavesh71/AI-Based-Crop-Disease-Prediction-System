# 🌱 AI Based Crop Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The **Crop Disease Prediction System** is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers diagnose crop diseases based on image analysis and environmental data. The system uses a deep learning model to classify diseases and provides treatment recommendations, improving agricultural productivity and reducing losses.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning-Based Disease Detection**: Predicts crop diseases using a trained deep learning model.
- **Intuitive Web Interface**: User-friendly UI with a green-themed aesthetic for ease of use.
- **Real-Time Weather Data Integration**: Enhances prediction accuracy by analyzing environmental conditions.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles.
- **Optimized Backend Performance**: Flask-based server with SQLAlchemy for efficient data handling.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Provides disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions in a structured format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap, AJAX)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL
- **Deployment**: AWS/GCP/Heroku (Optional)
